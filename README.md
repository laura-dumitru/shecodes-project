# SheCooks Veggie Recipes

A web page with vegetarian recipes which are displayed when the user **clicks** on a certain combination of ingredients. Only ingredients that form a **recipe** will unlock it, anything else will display an emoji. I enjoy putting together vegetarian recipes in my spare time and this project came as an inspiration from it.   
Technologies learned: **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**.  

How to use:
Pick a combination of **_two_** ingredients to unlock your veggie recipe by clicking into the boxes. There are **_14_** hidden recipes. Can you unlock them all?
